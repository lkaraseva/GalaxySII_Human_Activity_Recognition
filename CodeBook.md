# Introduction and data set descriptions
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis

> Data Source

The data is coming from Machine Learning Repository UCI:

> Data Set Information

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

> Attribute Information

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

## Step 1
> Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set

1. `'train/X_train.txt': Training set` and `'train/y_train.txt': Training labels` were merged together in order to identify types of activities tracked
2. `'test/X_test.txt': Test set` and `'test/y_test.txt': Test labels` were merged together in order to identify types of activities tracked
3. Data Sets from points 1 and 2 above were binded together in order to create one data set `test_and_train_df`

## Step 2
> Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

Regular expressions were used within `grep` FUN to identify required variable, i.e. ones that included `mean()` and `std()` obesrvations.
Returned vector was applied to `test_and_train_df` to filter out other variables. The resulting data frame named as `filtered_full_df1`.

## Step 3
> Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

`filtered_full_df1` was merged with `activity_labels` in order to match numbers with activity names. The names were populated but the numbers were dropped, resulting in creation of another intermediate data frame called `human_activities_full`. 

## Step 4 
> Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names

A series of editing actions was applied to variable names in `human_activities_full`. Included: elaboration on abbriviated terms, getting rid of special symbols like "-" and "(), lowering all cases.

## Step 5
> From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

`human_activities_full` has been grouped by activity types. The data frame has been summarized by activity types using mean FUN. The resulting and final data frame was called `human_activities_summary`.
